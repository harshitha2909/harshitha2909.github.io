    <h3>Project description:</h3>
    <p> More and more medical applications are being created every day. After the pandemic's breakout, people are suddenly concerned about their health. People want to know how they are doing right now so they may decide what to do about their health in an educated manner. COVID-19 has had an impact on millions of lives worldwide. People respect their health highly now more than ever before. This shift in emphasis has also had an effect on healthcare apps. One of our main inspirations for creating this app was the necessity for patients to receive quick care. The fact that people aren't always willing to assume complete responsibility for their own treatment is a serious issue in the field of health. By considering the present need of the world, we are building an application which helps the users by providing primary medication according to the symptoms provided by the user.It also provides online consultation with a specialized doctor in order to provide treatment for the patient as soon as possible.</p>
